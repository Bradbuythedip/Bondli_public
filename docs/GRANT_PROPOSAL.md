# Bondli: AI-Powered DePIN Aggregation for Solana

**Website:** [bondli.fun](https://bondli.fun) | **Twitter:** [@Bondlifun](https://x.com/Bondlifun) | **Status:** Live on Solana Mainnet

---

## The Problem

1. **Idle GPUs are wasted capital.** Millions of consumer NVIDIA GPUs sit idle while decentralized AI networks need compute. Onboarding to networks like Nosana requires DevOps expertise most GPU owners lack.

2. **Memecoin traders fly blind.** Solana launches 10,000+ tokens/day. Traders have no real-time intelligence to separate signal from noise, and rug pulls drain ~$200M+ annually from retail participants.

---

## The Solution — Bondli

Bondli is a **two-sided platform** connecting GPU compute supply with AI-powered trading intelligence on Solana.

| GPU Earnings (DePIN)                       | ML Trading Terminal                          |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| One-command GPU onboarding to Nosana       | 40+ ML features scored per token in <5ms     |
| Earn $NOS tokens for AI inference jobs     | 12+ rug detection signals with auto-reject   |
| Remote node control from web dashboard     | Score derivatives (velocity + acceleration)   |
| Real-time power, fan, clock monitoring     | 3-layer autonomous exit system               |
| 90-95% earnings to user, 5-10% to treasury| Online learning — model retrains on outcomes  |

**The flywheel:** GPU earnings fund trading activity. Trading fees fund GPU fleet growth. Both sides generate protocol revenue.

## Team

**Bradbuythedip** — Founder & Lead Developer
Full-stack engineer building at the intersection of DePIN, AI/ML, and Solana DeFi. Shipped the entire Bondli stack solo — from ML scoring engine to GPU fleet management to production deployment.

## Why Now

- **DePIN is accelerating** — Nosana, Render, io.net proving decentralized compute demand
- **Solana memecoin volume** is at all-time highs — traders need intelligence tooling
- **Consumer GPU surplus** — post-mining, millions of GPUs need productive use cases
- **Bondli is already live** — this is a scaling grant, not a build grant
